Privacy policy
==============

This extension does not use or store any user data. 

All it does is replace the text `slop` with `Nadella` in the content of websites currently open in your browser.

All processing is done locally – there is no server-side component. 

Your data never leaves your computer, therefore it's 100% private when it comes to this extension.
